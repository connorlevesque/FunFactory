To run Fun Factory on your mac, run the FunFactory_Mac.app executable and select a large screen size (such as 2880x1800). Because the UI was designed for an iPhone screen some of the UI elements may be oddly sized. However, this does not affect gameplay. Consult the instructions page for a basic overview of the game's rules.
