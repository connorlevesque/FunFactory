Game loop when running factory:

  A factory step is one cycle of component operations.
  These component operations occur in an order over multiple frames if necessary.
  Sample component ordering:
    Generator/Conveyor Belt
    Welder
    Pusher
    Spinner

  A factory step is made up of frames.
