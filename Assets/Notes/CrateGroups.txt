Moving Crate Groups

- multiple directions of movement

- given single direction of movement
  - check that all crates in group can move
      - handle moving offscreen
      - check for obstacles
      - check if blocking crate (groups) can move

For each crate group:
- each conveyor belt, pusher, generator attempts to record a force acting on the group of crates
- discard all forces which could not be applied (if they were the only such force)
- resolve conflicts in the remaining forces
    - opposing forces cancel
    - check if one is in the majority
    - if still tied, add previous force and repeat



- record forces
- remove invalid forces
- resolve remaining forces
- record dominate force as lastForce

^direct object is crate group (not single crate)

forces = unrealized movements


rotation
- record rotation forces
- remove invalid rotation forces
    - all intervening spaces must be passable
    - can you move crates that are there?
        - nope! must be totally clear
- resolve remaining rotation forces
    - opposing forces cancel
    - with multiple forces pick anchor
        - could potentially just pick one


rotation competes with translation
